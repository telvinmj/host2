#### Description:
The Hostel Maintenance Management System is a user-friendly website designed to streamline the process of registering and resolving complaints related to hostel room cleaning and maintenance. The system aims to improve communication and efficiency by eliminating the need for physical registration and providing administrators with a comprehensive overview of pending tasks.

#### Reason
In hostel environments, it is common to face challenges when it comes to getting rooms cleaned or requesting maintenance. The traditional method of registering complaints involved physically going to a designated location and writing them in a book. This process often led to delays and missed opportunities for room cleaning, as residents or their roommates had to remember and find the time to submit their complaints.

To address this issue, the Hostel Maintenance Management System was developed as part of a CS50 final project. The idea behind this system was to create a user-friendly website where students could easily register their complaints, employees could view assigned tasks, and hostel block administrators could efficiently manage and assign pending tasks to employees. By implementing this system, the goal is to simplify the complaint registration process, eliminate reliance on roommates, and provide administrators with an organized view of pending complaints, ultimately improving the overall hostel maintenance experience.

#### How It Works
The Hostel Maintenance Management System consists of a website with different functionalities for three types of users: students, employees, and administrators.

Students: Students can create an account and use the website to register their complaints regarding room cleaning or maintenance. They can access their personalized dashboard, view the status of their complaints, and mark them as completed when the task is done.

Employees: Employees can create an account and log in to view the tasks assigned to them. They can see the maintenance requests from students and work on them accordingly. However, employees do not have the authority to mark tasks as completed.

Administrators: Administrators have access to a comprehensive view of all the complaints registered by students. They can review pending complaints, identify any unfulfilled requests, and assign employees to specific floors. By assigning floors, administrators ensure that employees receive maintenance requests from students belonging to those assigned floors.

The system is implemented using Flask, a web framework, and incorporates various Flask modules such as Flask-WTF, Flask-Login, and Flask-Bcrypt for user authentication and form handling. The project includes a total of 13 HTML pages, including login and registration pages for students, employees, and administrators.

The Hostel Maintenance Management System aims to enhance communication, increase efficiency, and improve the overall hostel maintenance experience by providing a centralized platform for registering and resolving complaints.# host2
